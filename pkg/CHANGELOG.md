# Version 0.4.0 Beta
---

- Initial Beta Release
- Support for all essential graphical parameters: colors, line types, 
  line weights, semi-transparency, line endings and line joining.
- String width and character metrics are calculated by direct calls to a LaTeX
  compiler. This is an inefficient but robust method. Some of the inefficiency 
  of this method is compensated for by storing calculated string widths in a 
  database managed by the filehash package. This way if we pay a computational 
  price to compute the width of a string, we 
  hopefully only pay it once.
